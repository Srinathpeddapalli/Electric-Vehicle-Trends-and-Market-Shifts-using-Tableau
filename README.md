# Electric Vehicle Adoption Trends Analysis Project using Tableau

## Overview
This Tableau project analyzes the adoption trends of electric vehicles (EVs) across the United States, focusing on key metrics such as vehicle count by year, make, model, CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility, and vehicle type. By emphasizing Tesla’s strong market presence and distribution patterns across states, this project provides strategic insights into EV growth and regional adoption trends. Additionally, insights into Tesla’s market position and vehicle distribution inform industry stakeholders about the evolving landscape of the EV market in the U.S.
